# Ekki Múkk

This repository is a mirror of Tzingtao Chow's website, [*Ekki Múkk*](http://www.tzingtao.com).

Ekki Múkk means "No Sound" in Icelandic. The site was initiated in 2016 as a prebuilt Adobe Muse website template and later restarted as a self-hosted WordPress application. In June 2019, Ekki Múkk was migrated to a Hexo website and was open-sourced shortly after.

The theme used in Ekki Múkk, *Hugo*, was a derivative of the theme [Cactus](https://probberechts.github.io/hexo-theme-cactus/) by Probberechts. The derivation, however, was primarily carried out only on an architectural level. Most of the layout & styles were completely redesigned, preserving an original visual identity.
